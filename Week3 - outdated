# In a file called outdated.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a date, anno Domini, 
# in month-day-year order, formatted like 9/8/1636 or September 8, 1636

# Then output that same date in YYYY-MM-DD format. If the userâ€™s input is not a valid date in either 
# format, prompt the user again. Assume that every month has no more than 31 days; no need to validate 
# whether a month has 28, 29, 30, or 31 days.
