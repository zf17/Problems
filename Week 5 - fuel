# In a file called fuel.py, reimplement Fuel Gauge from Problem Set 3, restructuring your code per the below, wherein:

# convert expects a str in X/Y format as input, wherein each of X and Y is an integer, and returns that fraction as a percentage
# rounded to the nearest int between 0 and 100, inclusive. If X and/or Y is not an integer, or if X is greater than Y, then convert
# should raise a ValueError. If Y is 0, then convert should raise a ZeroDivisionError.

# gauge expects an int and returns a str that is:
#   "E" if that int is less than or equal to 1,
#   "F" if that int is greater than or equal to 99,
#   and "Z%" otherwise, wherein Z is that same int.
