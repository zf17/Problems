# In a file called professor.py, implement a program that:

#   Prompts the user for a level n, If the user does not input 1, 2, or 3, the program should prompt again.
#   Randomly generates ten (10) math problems formatted as X + Y = , wherein each of X and Y is a non-negative 
#   integer with n digits. No need to support operations other than addition (+).
#   Prompts the user to solve each of those problems. If an answer is not correct (or not even a number), the 
#   program should output EEE and prompt the user again, allowing the user up to three tries in total for that 
#   problem. If the user has still not answered correctly after three tries, the program should output the correct 
#   answer.
#   The program should ultimately output the userâ€™s score: the number of correct answers out of 10.

# Structure your program as follows, wherein get_level prompts (and, if need be, re-prompts) the user for a level and
# returns 1, 2, or 3, and generate_integer returns a randomly generated non-negative integer with level digits or raises
# a ValueError if level is not 1, 2, or 3:
