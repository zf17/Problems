# In a file called nutrition.py, implement a program that prompts consumers users to input a fruit 
# (case-insensitively) and then outputs the number of calories in one portion of that fruit, per the 
# FDA’s poster for fruits, which is also available as text. Capitalization aside, assume that users 
# will input fruits exactly as written in the poster (e.g., strawberries, not strawberry). Ignore any
# input that isn’t a fruit.
