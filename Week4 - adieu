# In a file called adieu.py, implement a program that prompts the user for names, one per line, until the user inputs
# control-d. Assume that the user will input at least one name. Then bid adieu to those names, separating two names 
# with one and, three names with two commas and one and, and n names with n-1 commas and one and, as in the below:

# Adieu, adieu, to Liesl
# Adieu, adieu, to Liesl and Friedrich
# Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, and Louisa
# Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, and Kurt
# Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, and Brigitta
# Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, and Marta
# Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl
