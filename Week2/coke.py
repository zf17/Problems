# Suppose that a machine sells bottles of Coca-Cola (Coke) for 50 cents and only 
# accepts coins in these denominations: 25 cents, 10 cents, and 5 cents.

# In a file called coke.py, implement a program that prompts the user to insert a coin,
# one at a time, each time informing the user of the amount due. Once the user has inputted 
# at least 50 cents, output how many cents in change the user is owed. Assume that the user
# will only input integers, and ignore any integer that isnâ€™t an accepted denomination.

amount = 50
while amount > 0:
    print(f"Amount Due: {amount}")
    coin = int(input("Insert Coin: "))
    if coin == 25 or coin == 10 or coin == 5:
        amount -= coin
print(f"Change Owed: {0-amount}")
